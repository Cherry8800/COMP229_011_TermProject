COMP229 – Web Application Development
Project Part 2 – First Release
Due: End of Week 9
Value: 10%

First Release

Overview:

1.	Your team is responsible for the first release of your Web Application. This is NOT a complete web application but rather your first project release containing some complete elements and progression towards a fully polished site.

●	Your site must include a Landing Page that is appropriate for the type of Web Application you have selected and should include the Name of the Site and your Team’s Logo. A hero button or link should allow the user to create an appropriate object or data associated with the type of site you have selected to build (e.g. a Survey Site should allow the user to create a Survey, a Tournament site should allow the user to create a Tournament, a Incident Management site should allow the user to create an new Incident record, Learning Management System App, Library app, Dental app, social media app etc).

●	Your Landing Page should allow the user to view an appropriate list of appropriate objects in a table format or dashboard created for the type of site you have selected to build (e.g. a Survey Site should list publicly available and active surveys, a Tournament site list active tournaments, a Incident Management site should list active tickets or incident records).

●	Your site should allow the user to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on the type of objects and data relevant to the site you have selected to build.

●	Authentication is not required at this stage of development

●	Your site does not have to be pretty at this stage, just functional.

2.	Include a first draft of an External Design Document that includes Your Team Name, Logo, Table of Contents, Wireframes for most top-level features of your site, and initial screen shots. You may also include Colour swatches and samples of your Main Navigation strategy.
3.	Your team must also demonstrate progress towards the final web application project by providing a link to the project's GitHub repository. Ensure the repository contains commits from each member of the group. Ensure your project is organized, understandable and named appropriately.
4.	You must keep track of your project by using an Agile Project Management tool (e.g. Jira, Trello, etc.). Your tracking tool should include a Product Backlog and a Task Board.
5.	Create a Short Video presentation on YouTube or another streaming provider. You must include a short PowerPoint (or Google Slides) Slide Deck that includes two slides.
 
a.	The First Slide of your Slide Deck must include, your Team Name and Logo (developed during Contract creation and Team Formation), the Full Names and Student IDs of all team members involved in the project, the Course Code, Course Name, and your Project information (which type of project you have selected)
b.	The Second Slide of your Slide Deck must include current images (mugshots) of each team member (no avatars allowed) that are displayed appropriately on the page. The team member’s Full Name and Role must appear underneath their image.

c.	One or more team members will demonstrate your site’s functionality. They must showcase each page working properly

d.	One or more team members will briefly describe the code in your web application that drives the functionality of various features of your site.

e.	Sound for your Video must be at an appropriate level so that the voice of any presenter may be clearly heard, and the screen resolution should be set so that code and site details are clearly visible.

f.	Your Short Video should run no more than 5 to 10 minutes.
